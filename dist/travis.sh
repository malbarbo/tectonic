# This script handles most of the Travis processing. Travis lets you break
# your build into a bunch of steps in their YAML file, but that don't provide
# much value for us since we barely use their built-in features. So we just
# have a big script that does almost everything.
#
# For each CI'd commit, this script will be run numerous times -- once for
# each item in the build matrix defined in .travis.yml.
#
# This script might be run even *more* times when one commit corresponds to
# more than one "event": a pull request; a push to a branch; explicit trigger
# via the API; or timed trigger via cron.
#
# Finally, we might have multiple forks of the repo, each seeing the same
# commits but CI'ing them in various ways.
#
# So, it's complicated.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# ... but not actually, due to travis-ci/travis-ci#6018. Sleeping upon exit
# helps avoid truncated logs.
